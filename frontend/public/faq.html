            <!-- faq answer -->

            <div class="faq-body">
                <p>We count each day that you have the item as one day. We do not double book days because we need time to inspect and clean the items to our very high standards.</p>

            <div class="faq-body">
                <p>Yes. As a general rule, we have a 2-day minimum rental period. However, Providers can decide to offer one day rentals for certain situations, such as party rentals.
                    If you are interested in a 1 or 2 day rental, please reach out to the Provider to see if they can accommodate your request.</p>

            <!-- faq question -->
            <h1 class="faq-page">What is the Rentitus service fee?</h1>

            <!-- faq answer -->
            <div class="faq-body">
                <p>To help cover the costs of running Rentitus including processing fees, customer support, and our Trust and Safety program, we charge customers a service fee between 7% and 9% every time a reservation is made through our platform.
                    The amount of this service fee is based on the reservation subtotal of rental and delivery charges (before other fees and taxes).
                    The exact amount of the service fee is displayed before a customer pays for their reservation and is also displayed in the cart, delivery information, billing information and payment pages.
